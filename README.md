# How this should work 

* 1. So it first go and search Abortion 
* 2. Then it pick the last viewable creator 
* 3. Starts requesting the following features : 
    - Unique Identifier	URL	Title	Creator	All Time Views	Favorites	Number of Quotes	Script
* 4. The URL is = base URL + Unique Identifier (which I will process later)
